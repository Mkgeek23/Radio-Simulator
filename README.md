# radio-demo
The project presents a fully functional car radio simulator.
It has all the functionalities of an original device. These are: working buttons for turning the device on / off, volume control (including mute), changing the reception frequency, saving stations and switching between them. Moreover, the music will be played, only after selecting the frequency on which there is actually a radio broadcast, it will snow on others.
